# My-Portfolio
  My portfolio is a showcase of my projects, skills, and personal information. It serves as a platform to demonstrate my expertise in web development.

## Features
  Home Page: Displays my name, profile picture and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

  Projects Page: Showcases a collection of my projects with details and links.

  About Page: Provides more information about me.

  Contact page: Displays my contact information.

### Front-end Setup
   To run the front-end of the portfolio, follow these steps:

   1.Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
   2.Clone this repository to your local system.
   3.Navigate to the project root directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
   4.Once the installation is complete, run npm start to start the development server. 

   The front-end will be available at http://localhost:4000.

### JSON Server Setup
   The JSON server acts as a mock database for the portfolio project. It provides data for the projects and personal information displayed on the front-end.

 To run the JSON server, follow these steps:

    1.Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
    2.Clone this repository to your local system (if you haven't already).
    3.Navigate to the root directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
    4.Once the installation is complete, run json-server --watch db.json to start the JSON server. 
  
  The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

#### Data Management
    The front-end interacts with the JSON server to fetch project data and personal information. Requests to the JSON server are made using Axios, and the data is displayed on the respective pages.
